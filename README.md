This is my tryout for language identification.

### Problems

1. There are three languages: Spanish (ES), Portuguese (PT-PT) and English (EN) which need to be identified given a sentence.

2. There are two language variants: European Portuguese (PT-PT) and Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR), they should be tell apart given a sentence.

3. There are tweets written English and Spanish. Each token in a tweet should be identified to belong to 'en', 'es' or 'other' class.

There are additional info fro problems 1 and 2 in a [readme](./langid/README.md) under langid folder, and about the third problem in a  [readme](./code-switching/README.md) under code-switching folder.
